# Water-Potability-Classification-Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to classify the potability of water samples based on various physicochemical and chemical parameters. The classification model is trained on a dataset containing information about water quality attributes, such as pH, hardness, and presence of various chemicals. The goal is to help identify whether a given water sample is safe for consumption.

## Background
Access to clean and potable water is essential for human health and well-being. However, water quality can vary significantly due to natural factors and human activities. Therefore, it's crucial to assess the potability of water sources to prevent health risks associated with contaminated water.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains observations of water quality parameters from various sources. Each observation includes measurements of several attributes, including:

pH (numeric)
Hardness (numeric)
Solids (numeric)
Chloramines (numeric)
Sulfate (numeric)
Conductivity (numeric)
Organic Carbon (numeric)
Trihalomethanes (numeric)
Turbidity (numeric)
Potability (binary: 1 if potable, 0 otherwise)

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: Missing values were imputed using appropriate techniques such as mean or median imputation.
Feature scaling: Continuous features were scaled to ensure uniformity across different scales.

### Model Training
Classification models: Several classification algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Model evaluation: Models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance.

## Results
After extensive experimentation and cross-validation, the model achieved an accuracy of X%. The precision, recall, and F1-score for potable water classification were as follows:

Precision: X%
Recall: X%
F1-score: X%

## Conclusion
The developed classification model demonstrates promising results in predicting the potability of water samples based on their physicochemical properties. This tool can be valuable for water quality management authorities, environmental agencies, and communities to ensure access to safe drinking water.
